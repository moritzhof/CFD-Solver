# CFDLab: Group D Final Project
TUM Informatics: CFD

This repository contains the Finite Volume Method Solver applied to Computational Fluid Dynamics.

In order to compile and execute, open up your terminal of choice and navigate to where you cloned the repository.
Once in, simply type "make" to compile, followed by "./sim" to execute. Options will then be displayed with the choices of:

* Driven Cavity
* Supersonic Compressible Flow
* Shallow Water
* Breaking Dam

Select the appropriate number for your desired choice, then to respective vtk files will be generated, These vtk files will then be used in Paraview for visualization.

## There are several simulation results available to view in the gifs folder (all in gif file format).
